#Lesson 1 Notes

Eulerian Path

- exactly two nodes have an odd degrees of connection

Eulerian Tour

- All nodes have an even degree of connection

an Algorithm maps a problem specification to the solution
- the strategy without the code.
- has correctness
-- whether it works or not.
- has efficiency
-- how fats it is, irregard the machine.
